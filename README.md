## 🚀 About Me

**YOU DON'T NEED A SCRIPT. YOU NEED INFRASTRUCTURE.**

Freelance scripts are fragile. They break when layouts change, they fail under load, and they produce messy data. I build **ENTERPRISE-GRADE DATA ACQUISITION PIPELINES** designed for stability, scalability, and strict schema compliance.

I am a **Data Acquisition Engineer** specializing in high-volume extraction systems. I treat web scraping as a critical engineering challenge, using Distributed Systems principles (Queues, Workers, Idempotency) to ensure your data feed never stops.

- 🎯 **Specializing in**: Python Scraping Infrastructure, ETL, Distributed Systems
- 💼 **Current focus**: Building Fault-Tolerant Data Pipelines
- 💡 **Passionate about**: Converting unstable scripts into resilient infrastructure
- 📫 **How to reach me**: islahwebservice@gmail.com | [www.islahwebservice.com](https://www.islahwebservice.com)
- 🔗 **Upwork Profile**: [Top Rated Freelancer](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01b8536031a7fb4468)

## ⚙️ Engineering Approach: Beyond "Just Scraping"

My delivery is a Dockerized, Fault-Tolerant System, not a `.py` file.

<tr>
<td width="33%">

### 1️⃣ Resilient Architecture
- **Distributed Workers**: Decoupled extraction from processing using Django-Q/Redis. Scaling horizontally to handle 1M+ requests.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Stateful recovery systems that resume exactly where they left off.
- **Rate Governance**: Smart logic to respect `Retry-After` headers and manage API quotas.

</td>
<td width="33%">

### 2️⃣ Data Integrity (ETL)
- **Schema Validation**: Strict enforcement (Pydantic/JSON-Schema) before data enters your warehouse. No more broken JSON.
- **Deduplication**: Intelligent hashing algorithms to prevent duplicate records.
- **Observability**: Custom Vue.js/Streamlit dashboards to monitor pipeline health and proxy latency.

</td>
<td width="33%">

### 3️⃣ Compliance & Anti-Bot
- **Ethical Harvesting**: TLS Fingerprinting (JA3) and coherent headers to mimic legitimate traffic.
- **Proxy Orchestration**: Smart rotation of Residential/Mobile IPs based on target domain strictness.
- **Bot Mitigation**: Handling Cloudflare, Akamai, and Datadome challenges.

## 🚀 Production Systems Built

### 📡 [Enflow - Distributed Data Enrichment Engine](https://enflowpy.vercel.app/)
**Architecture**: Django 5, Redis, Celery, Docker
*   **The System**: An orchestration layer integrating 5+ external Data APIs (Apollo, Hunter, etc.).
*   **Key Engineering**: Implemented "Cost-Least-Routing" algorithms and smart queue systems handling 50k+ daily transaction spikes with 99.9% availability.

### 🕸️ [ScrapeHub - Universal E-Commerce Extraction](https://scrapehub.onrender.com/)
**Architecture**: Python, Playwright, BeautifulSoup, PostgreSQL
*   **The System**: A modular extraction engine for unstructured e-commerce HTML.
*   **Key Engineering**: built a "Visual Selector Engine" for non-technical teams and integrated Dynamic Schema detection for JSON-LD parsing.

## 🎯 Why Hire Me?
1.  **You are building a BUSINESS**, not a hobby project. You need code that is maintainable, documented, and tested.
2.  **You need SCALE**. You process datasets that are too large for simple scripts.
3.  **You need RELIABILITY**. You want a system that wakes you up with an alert if it fails, rather than silently losing data.
