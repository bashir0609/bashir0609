# Job Titles for a Python Scraping Expert

Since you want to specialize in **Web Scraping** and **Data Extraction**, here are the specific titles you should target.

---

## 🔁 The "ETL Developer" Role (Simplified)
**Is it for you?** YES, but you need to frame it correctly.

Traditional ETL Developers move data from "Internal DB A" to "Internal DB B."
**You are an "External" ETL Developer.** You move data from the "Wild Web" to "Internal DB."

*   **Why apply?** It pays very well ($110k+) and is more stable than "Scraping" gigs.
*   **The Trap:** Avoid roles that require 100% SQL and Informatica/Talend.
*   **The Sweet Spot:** Look for **"Python ETL Developer"** roles. These almost always involve hitting APIs, scraping sites, and processing messy JSON—exactly what you are good at.

## 1. The Direct "Scraping" Titles
*These are the most obvious matches. Companies hiring for these need specific data NOW.*

*   **ETL Developer (External Data):** Focused on Extracting from 3rd party APIs and websites.
*   **Python Data Collector:** A straightforward title often used by AI/ML companies building datasets for training models.

## 3. The "Bot & Automation" Titles
*Focus on the "interaction" side—logging in, clicking buttons, automating workflows.*

*   **Bot Developer / Automation Engineer:** Building bots that buy sneakers, book tickets, or automate form submissions.
*   **Browser Automation Specialist:** Specifically highlights expertise in Playwright/Selenium/Puppeteer.
*   **RPA Developer (Python):** Robotic Process Automation. usually corporate boring stuff, but essentially screen scraping and clicking.

## 4. The "Intelligence & Security" Titles
*High-paying niche roles that use scraping for recon.*

*   **OSINT Specialist (Open Source Intelligence):** gathering data from social media and public sources for security/investigation firms.
*   **Competitive Intelligence Engineer:** Building systems to monitor competitors' tech, prices, and hiring.
*   **Threat Intelligence Analyst (Technical):** Scraping dark web or hacker forums (requires security clearance usually).
