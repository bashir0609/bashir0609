# Day 60: The Engineer (Graduation)

**Objective:** You are no longer a "Scraper". You are a Data Acquisition Engineer.

---

## 1. The Transformation
Look at what you built:
*   **Week 1:** You learned TLS spoofing (The Lockpick).
*   **Week 2:** You learned to patch Browsers (The Disguise).
*   **Week 3:** You learned Reverse Engineering (The Map).
*   **Week 4:** You learned MITM (The Wiretap).
*   **Week 5:** You learned Kafka (The Pipeline).
*   **Week 6:** You learned Airflow (The Conductor).
*   **Week 7:** You built the Engine (The Product).
*   **Week 8:** You Deployed it ( The Business).

## 2. The Resume
Update your CV/LinkedIn.
**Do NOT** write: "I know Python and Selenium."
**DO** write:
> "Data Acquisition Engineer | Expert in High-Scale Extraction Infrastructure."
> "Designed distributed systems scraping 10M+ pages/day using Async Python, Kafka, and Airflow."
> "Specialized in bypassing Cloudflare/Akamai using TLS Fingerprint Management and Mobile API Reverse Engineering."

## 3. The Interview Questions
Be ready for these:
1.  **"How do you handle IP Blocking?"**
    *   *Ans:* "I use a tiered proxy system and TLS spoofing to prevent detection first. If blocked, I rotate consumer groups."
2.  **"How do you scale to 1M pages?"**
    *   *Ans:* "Decouple extraction from storage. Use Kafka. Vertical scaling of Producers, Horizontal scaling of Consumers."
3.  **"How do you ensure data quality?"**
    *   *Ans:* "Pydantic schema validation at the ingestion point. Bad data goes to a Dead Letter Queue for analysis."

## 4. Final Words
The internet is changing.
"Script Kiddies" who use basic Selenium are dying.
**Engineers** who understand the Network Layer and Infrastructure are in high demand.

Congratulations. You are now part of the elite.
**Go build something massive.**
